  <!--About the Project-->
  
  ## About The Project
  
  
  There are many great README templates available on GitHub;however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this one. I wanted to create a README template which satisfies the project.
  
Here's why:

- A project that solves a problem and helps others.
- One shouldn't be doing the same task over and over like creating a README from scratch.
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So i'll be  adding more in the near future.You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project.Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgement section. Here are a few examples.

which sets up a default application setup automatically. To create a project, run the followingf command in cmd after downloading and sucessfully installing flutter:

'flutter create --org project_name'

### Prerequisites

After the installation is complete:

In the main file try running with the run without debugging:
